                        <p>Technology has made the requirement for information flow to be quick and effective. We have
                            been able to achieve this through the internet. We use mobile phones for almost everything
                            now. Gone are the days when we used them for only calling. Now our lives revolve around it.
                            They come in use for communicating through voice, messages, and mails. We can also surf the
                            internet using your phone. The phones of this age are known as smartphones.They are no less
                            than a computer and sometimes even more.
                            We see how mobile phones have replaced computers and laptops. We carry out all the tasks
                            through mobile phones, which we initially did use our computers.
                            Our aim is to launch new brand mobile phone and to be get succeed.</p>

                        <p>Most of the people in my survey have raised their preferences and the specialities. And also
                            every individual have their own stance to prefer or to purchase the mobile phone. The thing
                            that I have noticed during this plan that people are facing that software and security
                            issues. They are found out of the brand images and after the purchase of the phone they are
                            getting trouble with that.

                        <p>Smartphones overall are a helpful invention.They allow users to access the web and document
                            information easily. Smartphones act as a camera, notepads, calendars, alarm clocks, and
                            computers. The majority of concerns for smartphones have solutions making them more of a
                            help than a hazard. While smartphones have some security and social issues overall they are
                            devices of great utility that many people find necessary in their daily and professional
                            lives. </p>
